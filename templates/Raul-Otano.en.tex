\cvsection{Open Source}

\cvevent{}{Tree Extended}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/tree-extended}{rulyotano/tree-extended}}{
	{Tree Extended is an NPM package that can be installed globally, serving as a command-line tool for your terminal. It works seamlessly on Linux, Windows, and macOS. This tool is designed to generate text directory trees, similar to the "tree" command. What sets Tree Extended apart are its customizability features. You can tailor the output by applying filters, limiting the depth level of the tree, and choosing from a variety of character sets, including UTF-8, ASCII, or UTF-8 with icons. The project follows an automated deployment process to NPM using GitHub pipelines, ensuring accessibility to the wider developer community.}
}

\cvevent{}{Tree Extended VsCode Plugin}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/tree-extended-vscode}{rulyotano/tree-extended-vscode}}{
	{This one is a Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension that leverages the capabilities of the Tree Extended library to generate directory trees directly within the VSCode environment. This plugin streamlines the process, making it more user-friendly and accessible to everyone using VSCode for their development work. The project adopts an automated deployment process to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace, utilizing GitHub pipelines for seamless and efficient distribution.}
}

\cvevent{}{Rulyotano.Crosscuting}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/Rulyotano.CrossCutting}{Rulyotano.CrossCutting}, \href{https://github.com/rulyotano/rulyotano.crosscutting.js}{rulyotano.crosscutting.js}}{
	{These crosscutting libraries are my personal implementations, created during my available time. They automate the generation of NuGet packages for .NET and NPM packages for JavaScript. Within these libraries, you'll find a range of resources, including common algorithms and data structures that can be useful in various software projects. The most interesting one, in my opinion, is the \href{https://rulyotano.com/demos/bezier}{interpolation tool}, implemented for both, dotnet and js. We can get a Bezier curve that passes through a set of points previously defined. Also, there is a \href{https://github.com/rulyotano/wpf-bezier-interpolation}{WPF sample application}.}
}

\cvevent{}{Minesweeper}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/minesweeper}{rulyotano/minesweeper}, \href{https://minesweeper.rulyotano.com}{minesweeper.rulyotano.com}}{
	{This project began as a personal endeavor to create a Minesweeper game using the React.js and Redux patterns. What initially started as a simple example evolved into a fully working application. To put architectural knowledge to the test, I took on the challenge of dockerizing the application and expanded it by incorporating additional services, including a Redis database and a Traefik reverse proxy.},
        {The entire project was deployed on a Docker Swarm, hosted on a cost-effective VPS. Leveraging Docker Swarm ensures scalability and resilience for the application.},
	{The project remains a playground for continuous improvement. I actively use and enhance it, incorporating new features and experimenting with various aspects of software development.}
}

\cvevent{}{Httpd-spa Docker Image}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/httpd-spa}{rulyotano/httpd-spa}}{
	{This project provides a straightforward yet highly useful Docker image configuration. It's pre-configured to function as an Apache server specialized in serving single-page applications (SPAs). The specific challenge this image addresses is common in the context of SPAs: when SPAs manage routing internally, and the app is reloaded in sub-routes, the default httpd image attempts to locate other resources.},
        {Purpose: The image's purpose is to simplify the deployment of SPAs and ensure smooth routing, regardless of the internal management of routes within the SPA.},
	{Ease of Use: By using this Docker image, developers can quickly set up an Apache server configured to serve SPAs without the complications of managing route-related issues}
}

\cvevent{}{Cv}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/cv}{rulyotano/cv}}{
	{This open-source project offers a LaTeX-based CV template that is designed for professional use. The template is intended to serve as a foundation that can be adapted to various other LaTeX templates, making it highly versatile for individuals in need of a well-structured and customizable CV.},
        {Current State: The project is a continuous work in progress, reflecting the evolving needs of users and the incorporation of new design elements and features to enhance the template's usability.},
	{Versatility: The LaTeX CV template project aims to provide a flexible and adaptable solution for individuals looking to create a visually appealing and professionally formatted CV.}
}

\cvevent{}{Mui-profile}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/mui-profile}{rulyotano/mui-profile}}{
	{My personal profile website is built using React.js and Nuxt.js, showcasing a dynamic and interactive representation of my professional identity. Hosted on GitHub Pages, it provides a platform for sharing my skills, projects, and achievements, offering a comprehensive overview of my capabilities and experiences.},
        {This project is designed to be versatile and adaptable, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to create their own profile website. The website's codebase can be reused and customized for various purposes.},
	{I have authored \href{https://betterprogramming.pub/get-your-personal-website-for-free-create-it-with-reactjs-b7e3c3c874b4}{an informative article} detailing the development and setup of this website, which serves as a helpful guide for others interested in creating their own online profile.}
}

\cvevent{}{Coding interview preparation checklist}{\href{https://github.com/rulyotano/coding-interview-preparation-checklist}{rulyotano/coding-interview-preparation-checklist}}{
	{The "Coding Interview Preparation Checklist" is an open-source project primarily comprising a curated collection of references to valuable materials and resources for coding interview preparation. It serves as a comprehensive guide that directs individuals to a wide range of topics, strategies, and techniques essential for excelling in technical interviews.}
}
